# 🎬 Project 01 – Investigating Netflix Movies  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores Netflix’s catalog of movies from the 1990s. The goal is to practice data cleaning, filtering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and pandas, and to answer key questions about movie duration and genres.  

## 📂 Files  
- `Project_01_investigatingnetflixmovies.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis  
- `netflix_data.csv` (not included) → Dataset required to run the notebook  

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills  
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy)  
- Data cleaning (column renaming, extracting numeric durations, handling missing data)  
- Exploratory data analysis (filtering, distributions, value counts)  
- Visualization (histograms of durations, top genres)  

## 🔍 Key Questions  
1. What does the distribution of 1990s movie durations look like?  
2. How many short action films (<90 minutes) were released in the 1990s?  
3. What were the most common genres during that decade?  

## 📊 Insights  
- Most 1990s Netflix movies cluster around 90–120 minutes.  
- Only a small number of action films were shorter than 90 minutes.  
- Drama and comedy dominated the decade’s genre distribution.  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Compare duration trends across decades.  
- Expand analysis to regional availability.  
- Visualize results in an interactive dashboard.
